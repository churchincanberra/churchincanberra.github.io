# Our Faith

We hold the faith which is common to all the believers (Titus 1:4, Jude 3).

The Bible is the complete divine revelation inspired word by God through the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21, 2 Tim. 3:16).

God is uniquely one, yet triune - the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (1 Tim. 2:5a, Matt. 28:19).

The Son of God, even God Himself, was incarnated to be a man by the name of Jesus Christ (John 1:1, John 1:14).

Christ died on the cross for our sins, shedding His blood for our redemption (1 Pet. 2:24, Eph. 1:7a).

Christ resurrected from among the dead on the third day (1 Cor. 15:4).

Christ ascended to the right hand of God to be Lord of all (Acts 1:9, Acts 2:33, Acts 2:36).

Whenever any person repents to God and believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, he is regenerated (born again) and becomes a living member of the one Body of Christ (Acts 20:21, John 3:3, Eph. 1:22-23, Rom. 12:5).

Christ is coming again to receive His believers to Himself (1 Thes. 2:19).
