<p><span>1.&nbsp;CONFERENCE HOSPITALITY AND SATURDAY WORKING BEE</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the Canberra Blending Conference, we&nbsp;encourage the local saints to open their houses for accommodation for visiting saints. The brothers prepared&nbsp;a capacity form below to help us allocate the visiting saints to every house open for hospitality.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIkCQee55002eIUVgLxQw5FhIPZvcapkdPKzsnpo2fpGU3Mg/viewform" target="_blank">click here</a>&nbsp;to fill up the form.<br>
<br>
In line with preparation for&nbsp;the upcoming conference, there will be a working bee on September 7 (Saturday) at 2 pm. There will be a few sisters in the main room joining the Sister's Training so cleaning of the meeting hall will exclude this room. &nbsp;Our general cleaning includes but is not limited to cleaning the toilets, mapping the floor in the smaller rooms, and sweeping the dried leaves outside the hall. etc. We encourage the saints who are available to give a portion of their time to be in the meeting hall and help out with the cleaning chores. Please contact Brother Dermie (0411-728082) if you have any questions&nbsp;about the working Bee. (Mark 10:45 "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many")</p>
