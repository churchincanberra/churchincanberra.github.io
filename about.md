# Our Faith

We hold the faith which is common to all the believers (Titus&nbsp;1:4, Jude&nbsp;3).

The Bible is the complete divine revelation inspired word by God through the Holy Spirit (2&nbsp;Pet.&nbsp;1:21, 2&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;3:16).

God is uniquely one, yet triune - the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;2:5a, Matt.&nbsp;28:19).

The Son of God, even God Himself, was incarnated to be a man by the name of Jesus Christ (John&nbsp;1:1, John&nbsp;1:14).

Christ died on the cross for our sins, shedding His blood for our redemption (1&nbsp;Pet.&nbsp;2:24, Eph.&nbsp;1:7a).

Christ resurrected from among the dead on the third day (1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;15:4).

Christ ascended to the right hand of God to be Lord of all (Acts&nbsp;1:9, Acts&nbsp;2:33, Acts&nbsp;2:36).

Whenever any person repents to God and believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, he is regenerated (born again) and becomes a living member of the one Body of Christ (Acts&nbsp;20:21, John&nbsp;3:3, Eph.&nbsp;1:22-23, Rom.&nbsp;12:5).

Christ is coming again to receive His believers to Himself (1&nbsp;Thes.&nbsp;2:19).
