The Church in Canberra is in fellowship with many churches around Australia. We stand as the local church in each locality, and practice the oneness of the Body of Christ.

"And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all." - Ephesians 1:22-23.

We have close blending and association with churches around Australia, including cities like Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Coffs Harbour, Gold Coast, Launceston, Melbourne, Perth, Scottsdale and Sydney. We have regular trainings and blending conferences each year, including a National Blending Conference in Sydney; a national training for serving ones (in Brisbane in 2017); a national conference for university students (in Sydney in 2017). Blending conferences also are held in various cities including Canberra, Tasmania, Perth and Adelaide.

Members of the churches are also encouraged to attend training programs for high school students, sisters, parents etc in others localities and cities.
