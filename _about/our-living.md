The Church in Canberra practices God man daily living. The believers’ living is a living that is unto the Lord by practicing daily walk with the Lord such as calling on the name of the Lord, praying unceasingly, observing morning revival, pursuing the Word, and shepherding one another in love. The outflow of this living reaches new contacts and believers who are attracted by the living Christ lived out from the believers. Nourishing and shepherding amongst us often takes place at university campuses and homes - believers and new contacts are fed properly through regular meetings in these settings so that they can grow in Christ as functioning members of the Body of Christ. As a result of the vision of the God-ordained way, many young people participate in the corporate living where they can pursue the Lord and be built up in love. The Church in Canberra currently has weekly group meetings and life-study pursuit meetings.
