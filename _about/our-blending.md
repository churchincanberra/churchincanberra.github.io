The Church in Canberra is in fellowship with many churches around Australia. We stand as the local church in each locality, and practice the oneness of the Body of Christ.

"And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all." &ndash;Ephesians&nbsp;1:22-23.

We have close blending and association with churches around Australia, including localities like Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Gold Coast, Launceston, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. We have regular trainings and blending conferences each year, including a National Blending Conference in Sydney; a national training for serving ones; a national conference for university students. Blending conferences also are held in various cities including Canberra, Tasmania, Perth and Adelaide.

Members of the churches are also encouraged to attend training programs for high school students, sisters, parents, etc in other localities.
